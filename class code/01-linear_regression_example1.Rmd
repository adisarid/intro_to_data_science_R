## Read the dataset

We're using a data set with countries and the various types of alchohol consumption. The dataset was downloaded from the [tidytuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), the data set from Tuesday the 26th, 2018.

We also add some country metadata from the [worldbank](https://data.worldbank.org/) and classification to continents from [here](https://datahub.io/JohnSnowLabs/country-and-continent-codes-list#data), then filtered some countries with missing data.

```{r read alchohol data}
alchohol <- read_csv("https://github.com/sarid-ins/statistical_learning_course/raw/master/datasets/alchohol_consumption/alchohol_consumption_ready.csv") %>% 
  distinct(country, .keep_all = T)

```

## The beer model

How much beer is drank, as a function of spirit, wine, gdp per capita, and continent?
Beer, spirit, and wine data for 2010, servings consumed per person, see [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/).

```{r the beer model}

beer_lm <- lm(beer_servings ~ spirit_servings + wine_servings + gdp2010 + Continent_Name,
              data = alchohol)

summary(beer_lm)

```

Let's analyze this model, step-by-step.

### The `Call:`

First, the `Call:` simply repeats what we "ordered".

### Residuals

The residuals provide the individual errors, i.e. the elements of the RSS (residual sum of squares).

***

**Question: what is the average of the residuals?**

***

Usually what we love to see is that the residuals are evenly distributed around $y=0$, with a similar variance along the $x$ axis, however this is not necessarily the case here. E.g., see how the variance decreases in the "wine servings" variable?

No matter, we can still make do.

```{r}
alchohol_residuals <- alchohol %>% 
         mutate(res = beer_lm$residuals) %>% 
         select(country, spirit_servings:wine_servings, res) %>% 
         gather(variable, x_value, -res, -country)

ggplot(alchohol_residuals,
       aes(x = x_value, y = res)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~ variable) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("Residual") + 
  xlab("Number of servings")
```

By sorting the residuals, we can see where the model overshoots or undershoots, i.e., the 10 farthest predictions.
```{r overshoot undeshoot}
alchohol %>% 
  mutate(res = beer_lm$residuals) %>%
  select(country, spirit_servings:wine_servings, res) %>% 
  arrange(desc(res)) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

### The regression table

Enough about residuals, let's talk about the coefficients table. The `(intercept)` represents the model's $\beta_0$. The rest of the coefficients, as specified. 

   * `Estimate` is the $\beta$ itself. 
   * `Std. Error` is the estimate's variance (e.g., if we do this "measurement survey" again, and again, we might get some variations of the data. For each such variation we will get a different $\hat{\beta_i}$'s. These coefficients have a distribution, and this is an estimate to their standard error.
   * The `t value` and the `Pr(>|t|)` (a.k.a., p-value) are significance tests based on the normal distribution, with statistic $\hat{\beta}_i$ and $\sigma$ as the std. error. A really high `t value` corresponds with a really low `Pr(>|t|)` value, and indicates that the coefficient is different than $0$.
   * The stars indicate various levels of p-value. Special attention is given to $p<0.05$, though the p-value is [heavily disputed](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.XSx3YugzaUk) in our era of really big samples.
   
### Treatment of categorial variables

Note the special treatment of categorial variables (i.e., `Continent`).

*** 

**How many continents in the regression versus the levels in the data? why?**

***

### The residual standard error

The residual standard error, at the buttom of the table, reports an estimate for the $\epsilon$'s (error) standard deviation. While degrees of freedom signifies the sample size minus the number of coefficients, i.e.: $df=n-p-1$.

### Multiple $R^2$ and Adjusted $R^2$

These measure the fitness of the model. The $R^2$ is the proportion of our model to a nominal naive model (a simple average). The Adjusted $R^2$ uses a similar approach but "fines" the use of many features.

### The F-Statistic (and hypothesis testing)

The F-statistic is the ratio of:

\[
F = \frac{(TSS-RSS)/p}{RSS/(n-p-1)}
\]

It has its own "F distribution" when normality and homoschedastity of the model are assumed. 

Is can be used for the significance test which examines the hypothesis:
\[
H_0:\beta_0=\beta_1=\beta_2=\ldots=\beta_p=0\\
\]
Versus the alternative (at least one $\beta_i$ is non-zero)

Really high values of $F$ correspond to really low p-values, validating in a sense an overall relationship between the response and predictors.


# Transformations

We can use various transformations on-the-fly, when the variables are entered into the regression model.

***

**What transformation would you try on the gdp per capita variable to improve the model?**

```{r}
head(alchohol, 15) %>% 
  select(country:Continent_Name) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

***

### Relative importance with `relaimpo`

Each time we add a new variable to a model, our $R^2$ increases by a certain amount. However, the contribution of a new variable changes according to variables already in the model. For example:

```{r rsquare demonstration}

# just spirit
summary(lm(beer_servings ~ spirit_servings, alchohol))$r.squared

# just wine
summary(lm(beer_servings ~ wine_servings, alchohol))$r.squared

# spirit and wine
summary(lm(beer_servings ~ spirit_servings + wine_servings, alchohol))$r.squared

# adding continent
summary(lm(beer_servings ~ spirit_servings + Continent_Name, alchohol))$r.squared
summary(lm(beer_servings ~ wine_servings + Continent_Name, alchohol))$r.squared
summary(lm(beer_servings ~ spirit_servings + wine_servings + Continent_Name, alchohol))$r.squared
```

In this case: 

   * The contribution of wine added 0.23 to the $R^2$ (compared to a nominal model with just spirit)
   * The contribution of spirit added 0.13 to the $R^2$ (compared to a nominal model with just wine)
   * The contribution of continent ranges in 0.08-0.207, depending on when you add it.
   
The `relaimpo` package provides an analysis on all combinations (of the average $R^2$ increase).
Note the use of `factor` to transform `Continent_Name` (otherwise the function fails).
   
```{r relaimpo example}
#install.packages(relaimpo)

relaimpo::calc.relimp(lm(beer_servings ~ spirit_servings + wine_servings + log(gdp2010) + factor(Continent_Name), alchohol))

```

Surprisingly, the continent is found to have the largest "lmg" (short for Lindeman, Merenda and Gold which wrote the original paper), which is the $R^2$ contribution averaged over orderings among regressors.

### Feature selection

There are a number of "greedy" feature selection algorithms, known as stepwise: forwards, backwards, forward-backward.
Each algorithm starts from an initial model, define it as the "incumbent model". 

At each iteration, the algorithm runs all `lm` combinations of adding (or removing or adding/removing) a single feature to the incumbent model.

The algorithm selects the best model out of the examined models, using a criteria (e.g., AIC), and updates the "incumbent model".

The algorithm stops when the incumbent model cannot be improved.

In R, the function `MASS:stepAIC` can be used for stepwise. It utilizes the AIC (Akaike information criterion):

\[
AIC = -2\ln(\hat{L}) + 2k
\]

Where $\hat{L}$ is the likelihood and is defined as:

\[
\hat{L}(\theta) = f(y_1|\theta)\times\ldots\times f(y_n|\theta)=\Pi_{t=1}^nf(y_t|\theta)
\]

In the case of linear regression, the AIC is equivalent to $2k+n\ln(RSS)$.

We illustrate the use of `stepAIC`.

```{r stepwise}

beer_step_bth <- MASS::stepAIC(beer_lm, direction = "both")
beer_step_bck <- MASS::stepAIC(beer_lm, direction = "backward")

base_mod <- lm(beer_servings ~ 1, data = alchohol)
base_update <- update(base_mod, . ~ . -spirit_servings -wine_servings -gdp2010 -Continent_Name)
beer_step_fwd <- MASS::stepAIC(base_update,
                               scope = list(upper = ~ spirit_servings + wine_servings + gdp2010 + Continent_Name, 
                                            lower ~ 1),
  direction = "forward")

```

In this case, all three algorithms converge into the same model, with all variables except the gdp2010.

```{r stepwise res}
summary(beer_step_bth)
```

### How accurate is our prediction?

The prediction can be provided using a prediction interval. The difference between a confidence interval and a prediction interval is that a confidence interval is constant and uniform for all $x$. A prediction interval is like a confidence interval but for a $x_0$, i.e., $f(x_0)\in[lb,ub]$.

For example, here is the prediction interval of beer consumption for each of our observations.
Note that this is a "dumb" prediction, which does not consider variable range (i.e., there are negative values for consumption).

```{r prediction interval}
alchohol %>% 
  bind_cols(as_tibble(predict(beer_lm, 
                              interval = "prediction",
                              level = 0.95))) %>% 
  select(country, beer_servings, fit, lwr, upr)
```

It is nice to illustrate in a model with just two variables:

```{r prediction interval illustration}
ggplot(alchohol, aes(y = beer_servings, x = log(gdp2010))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, level = 0.95)
```

Note the following clarification: the prediction interval is a confidence interval to what would your prediction be when you recreate the experiment, and not the interval in which 95% of the points will fall into.

### Interactions between variables

Sometimes we want to examine the interactions between a number of variables, e.g., the influence of continent*gdp on the target variable beer consumption. In which case we add in the formula an interaction indicator, i.e.: `log(gdp2010):Continent_Name`.

```{r interactions}

lm_beer_interaction <- 
  lm(beer_servings ~ spirit_servings + wine_servings + log(gdp2010) + Continent_Name + log(gdp2010):Continent_Name,
     data = alchohol)

summary(lm_beer_interaction)

```

***

**In terms of the regression formula, a `log(gdp2010)*Contenent_NameAsia` has been added and is significant, but what is its influence (its meaning) on the target variable? can you explain what it does in terms of a new observation and the value it would predict to it?**
